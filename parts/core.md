# The Web Accessibility Framework: Core

[Home](../) | [Tiers](tiers.md) | [Profiles](profile.md)

## What is the Core?

The Core is one of three pieces of The Web Accessibility framework.

![Pie graphic with the three pieces of the Web Accessibility Framework: Core, Tiers, and Profile. Core is highlighted.](../images/web-accessibility-framework-parts-core.png)

It’s the foundation of the framework and is made up of five functions:

1. **Identify**: Define your scope, risk tolerance, and goals.
2. **Prevent**: Ways to prevent issues through training, procurement processes with 3rd party software, and change management processes.
3. **Detect**: Ways to detect issues with intentional sampling, manual testing, automated testing, and user feedback.
4. **Respond**: The organization’s response plan to issues including where they’re documented, how they’re prioritized, customer communication guidelines, and legal response plans.
5. **Remediate**: How your organization will fix issues and processes.

Each of these functions has categories with lists of accessibility outcomes organizations can work toward.

For example, Asset Management is a category in the Identify function. Here are some of the outcomes in this category:

* Public-facing websites and pages are inventoried
* Websites, pages, and flows behind logins are inventoried
* Content creation flows and systems are mapped
* Documents are inventoried
* Videos are inventoried

Organizations can use the Core on its own to start improving accessibility right away or it can be used with Profiles and Tiers to build an even more comprehensive accessibility strategy.

> [Example 1: Using only the Core](../examples/01_using_only_the_core.md) shows how the Core could be used.

## Who should use the Core?

Any piece of The Web Accessibility Framework can be used on its own and adjusted to fit an organization’s needs.

That said, the Core is great for all organizations to use. It is a great place for any organization to start especially if they aren’t sure where to begin, want to get started quickly, or are smaller with limited resources.

The Core’s outcomes are also used to build the Profile’s current and desired state. It also helps organizations understand all that goes into an accessibility strategy, so they better understand their current and desired Tier.
